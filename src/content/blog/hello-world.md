## Welcome to the new site!

I've rebuilt my personal website using [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator that offers incredible performance and flexibility. This post serves as both a test and an introduction to the new platform.

### Why I Switched to Astro

After using Gatsby for a while, I decided to try something new. Astro caught my attention for several reasons:

1. **Speed** - Astro sends less JavaScript to the browser, resulting in faster load times
2. **Flexibility** - I can use multiple frameworks together if needed
3. **Content Focus** - The content collections API makes managing blog posts much easier
4. **Developer Experience** - The development process is smooth and enjoyable

### What's New

In this new version of the site, you'll find:

- Improved navigation
- Better mobile experience
- Faster load times
- Same terminal-inspired design you're familiar with

### What's Coming

I have plans to add more features to the site, including:

- More digital garden entries
- Integration with more services

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to build and improve the site. And as always, feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions or just want to chat!

Stay frosty.
