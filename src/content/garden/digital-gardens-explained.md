## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a different approach to blogging and content creation. Instead of publishing polished, finished pieces, a digital garden is a collection of thoughts, ideas, and knowledge that grows and evolves over time.

Think of it as the difference between a carefully maintained garden that visitors see (a traditional blog) and a working space where you cultivate ideas, experiment, and let things grow naturally (a digital garden).

### Characteristics of Digital Gardens

- **Living documents** - Pages can be revisited and updated as your thinking evolves
- **Non-chronological** - Unlike blogs, gardens don't have to be organized by date
- **Interconnected** - Ideas link to each other, forming networks of thought
- **Work in progress** - Gardens embrace imperfection and continuous improvement

### Why Keep a Digital Garden?

Digital gardens provide several benefits:

1. **Lower the barrier to publishing** - You don't need a fully formed, perfect post
2. **Share learning in public** - Others can see your thought process and development
3. **Create unexpected connections** - As your garden grows, you'll find connections between seemingly unrelated ideas
4. **Build a personal knowledge base** - Your garden becomes a reflection of your thinking and learning

## My Approach to Digital Gardening

In my digital garden, I plan to:

- Share half-formed ideas that I'm still exploring
- Post technical notes and documentation for things I've learned
- Create evergreen resources that I can update over time
- Connect ideas across different domains of knowledge

This is just the beginning of this digital garden entry. I'll be updating it as I develop my own practice and learn more about effective digital gardening.
