        - Communicated with developers across the judiciary about emerging technologies that could overhaul the core applications used by districts across the country. That combined advocacy led to a container focused overhaul of the organization's core product offerings and a judiciary-wide OpenShift hosting environment that the District of Connecticut is currently piloting.
        - Implemented an iPad fleet and MachForm solution to shorten the process of gathering information from potential jurors, normalizing the data, and getting it into the hands of attorneys in high profile cases, by 92.5%.
