# Task Completion Checklist

## After Code Changes

### 1. Testing (⚠️ Not Currently Configured)
- **No testing framework is currently set up**
- **Recommendation**: Add Vitest for unit/component testing
- **Recommendation**: Add Playwright for e2e testing
- Manual testing required for now

### 2. Manual Testing Checklist
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test in browser at http://localhost:4321
# - Check responsive design (mobile/desktop)
# - Test terminal typing animations
# - Verify navigation works
# - Check blog/garden post rendering
# - Test image loading
```

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Check for build errors or warnings
# Verify all pages render correctly in production mode
```

### 4. Code Quality (⚠️ Not Currently Configured)
- **No linting tools configured** (ESLint recommended)
- **No formatting tools configured** (Prettier recommended)
- **No pre-commit hooks** (Husky + lint-staged recommended)

### 5. Content Validation
- Verify markdown frontmatter follows schema
- Check that images load correctly
- Ensure internal links work
- Validate accessibility of content

### 6. Git Workflow
```bash
# Review changes
git status
git diff

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# Push to trigger Netlify deployment
git push origin main
```

### 7. Deployment Verification
- Wait for Netlify build to complete
- Check live site at henryneeds.coffee
- Verify all functionality works in production
- Check that new content appears correctly

## When Adding New Features

### Before Implementation
- Update relevant spec documentation
- Consider impact on existing components
- Plan for responsive design
- Consider terminal theme consistency

### After Implementation  
- Update README.md if necessary
- Add documentation for new features
- Test across different devices/browsers
- Update any relevant memory files

## Recommended Improvements for Task Completion
1. **Add Vitest**: For component and utility testing
2. **Add Playwright**: For end-to-end testing  
3. **Add ESLint**: For code linting
4. **Add Prettier**: For code formatting
5. **Add Husky**: For pre-commit hooks
6. **Add CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing
